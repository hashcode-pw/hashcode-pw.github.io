                    <p>BootCamp is a full time, intensive 12 week apprenticeship
                        program specially designed to train you on latest web development
                        technologies. There are no classrooms; focus is on hands-on,
                    project based learning.</p>
                    <p>You cannot learn to ride a bike in a classroom. Only way is to
                        get on the bike and start paddling. Similarly, only way to
                        learn advance web development is by writing code &mdash;
                        a lot of code.</p>

                    <p><strong>God Sent!</strong> We have hired a few senior developers who had worked with Mir Nazim earlier. For some it was their first job, and therefore clearly they had been trained in both technology and client management by the leadership at the company. We've been thrilled with the people who have stayed with us. They are growing and taking senior leadership positions at Srijan and managing some big accounts for us.</p>

                    <p>We would highly recommend this bootcamp. And yes, we're looking to get some people onboard in New Delhi and Bangalore, and would love to have them be from Kashmir, and passing out of this bootCamp. We're taking baby steps regularly to have a Srinagar office, and hiring a few interns from the region is one such step.</p>
